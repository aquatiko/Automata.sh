# Automata.sh
A set of recipes for automating Linux tasks.

*Because we were built to do greater things!!*

# To-do
1. Memory hogging task killer.

    So a bunch of tasks opens up in the background and if left for a while starts to Memory read a lot and makes my PC slower.

    Aim is to kill them automatically after they cross a threshold. I will customize it so that it can be easier to modify too.

    PS: I was killing them manually for a month now in the task manager every time I boot my PC.
2. Working IP switcher.

   Everytime our college LAN goes down, all our frustated engineers starts to panic even more.

   Aim is to switch to a working IP or check real fast and tell them that it's actually gone.
